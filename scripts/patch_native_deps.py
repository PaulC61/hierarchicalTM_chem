"""Patch known portability issues in vendored native submodules (dev/*).

The upstream `cair/tmu` C extension hardcodes the x86-only `-mrdrnd` compiler
flag (used nowhere in its actual source -- it only calls `xorshift128p_seed`/
`pcg32_seed`), which fails to build with clang on Apple Silicon (osx-arm64)
and on some non-x86_64 Linux hosts (e.g. linux-aarch64). Since dev/tmu is a
pinned git submodule we don't control upstream, this script strips that flag
from the submodule's *local checkout* so `pixi install` can build it on any
of the platforms declared in pixi.toml. It's idempotent and safe to re-run
(e.g. after `git submodule update`), and is wired up as the pixi
`fix-submodules` task, which must run once after submodule init and before
`pixi install`.
